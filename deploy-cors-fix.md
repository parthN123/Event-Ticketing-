# 🚨 URGENT: Deploy CORS Fix

## Current Issue
The backend is deployed but CORS is still blocking your Vercel frontend.

## ✅ Fix Applied
- Added better CORS debugging
- Made CORS more permissive for Vercel domains
- Added pattern matching for `*.vercel.app`

## 🚀 Deploy Now

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd Backend

# Add changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix CORS: Add Vercel domain support and better debugging"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

## ⏱️ Wait for Deployment
- Render will automatically redeploy
- Wait 2-3 minutes
- Check Render logs for CORS debug messages

## 🔍 Check Logs
After deployment, check Render logs for:
```
CORS request from origin: https://event-ticketing-o6r7.vercel.app
CORS: Allowing Vercel origin: https://event-ticketing-o6r7.vercel.app
```

## ✅ Test After Deployment
1. Go to `https://event-ticketing-o6r7.vercel.app`
2. Try to log in
3. Check browser console - CORS errors should be gone

## 🆘 If Still Not Working
Check the exact origin being sent by looking at Render logs. The debug messages will show exactly what origin is being blocked.
